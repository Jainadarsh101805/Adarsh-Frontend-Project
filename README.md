# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Adarsh-Frontend-Project
This project allows you to visually design workflows using actions and decision branches. It is built to be simple, user-friendly, and practical for real-world logic building.  Click the start button below to begin creating your workflow and explore how decisions flow step by step.

# Visual Decision Flow Builder

Visual Decision Flow Builder is a frontend-based **workflow design application** that allows users to create and manage **decision-driven workflows** through a simple and interactive node-based interface. The application helps visualize logical flows clearly, making complex decision structures easy to design and understand.

This project focuses on frontend engineering concepts such as component-based design, state management, and intuitive UI/UX for logic-driven applications.

---

## 🚀 Workflow Builder Dashboard

The Workflow Builder Dashboard enables users to build workflows by adding different node types such as actions, conditions, and endpoints. Each workflow represents a structured decision flow, allowing users to visualize both sequential and conditional logic effectively.

This project was developed to demonstrate:

* Frontend architecture and component design
* State and data flow management
* UI/UX decision-making
* Interactive visual logic building

## ✨ Features

* Interactive visual workflow canvas
* Start, Action, Branch (Condition), and End nodes
* Dynamic node creation at any stage of the workflow
* Real-time editing of node labels
* Automatic re-linking when nodes are removed
* Conditional branching with True / False paths
* Clean and minimal UI built from scratch
* No external UI or flow-diagram libraries

---

## 🧩 Node Types

| Node Type | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Start     | Entry point of the workflow           |
| Action    | Represents a single step or operation |
| Branch    | Conditional decision node             |
| End       | Terminates a workflow path            |
