# Adarsh-Frontend-Project
This project allows you to visually design workflows using actions and decision branches. It is built to be simple, user-friendly, and practical for real-world logic building.  Click the start button below to begin creating your workflow and explore how decisions flow step by step.

# Visual Decision Flow Builder

Visual Decision Flow Builder is a frontend-based **workflow design application** that allows users to create and manage **decision-driven workflows** through a simple and interactive node-based interface. The application helps visualize logical flows clearly, making complex decision structures easy to design and understand.

This project focuses on frontend engineering concepts such as component-based design, state management, and intuitive UI/UX for logic-driven applications.

## 🚀 Workflow Builder Dashboard

The Workflow Builder Dashboard enables users to build workflows by adding different node types such as actions, conditions, and endpoints. Each workflow represents a structured decision flow, allowing users to visualize both sequential and conditional logic effectively.

This project was developed to demonstrate:

* Frontend architecture and component design
* State and data flow management
* UI/UX decision-making
* Interactive visual logic building

## 🧩 Node Types

| Node Type | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Start     | Entry point of the workflow           |
| Action    | Represents a single step or operation |
| Branch    | Conditional decision node             |
| End       | Terminates a workflow path            |
